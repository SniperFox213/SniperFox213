### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Greetings, everyone!

You just found the profile of some other idiot, congratulations! Now let's not joke about it. I'm just gonna tell you quickly what I'm doing here and what I want to do. At the moment I am engaged in web development, Minecraft server development, and text translations (Yes, it's fanfics, and yes, I regret nothing).

Now, let me make this quick about what I'm trying to do here. I'm not looking for some kind of confession, no. I just like to do websites and stuff. That's why I've been developing a network of sites for several months, completely without advertising, and supported by the community. I'll make any website that I find interesting. That's why in the near future you will be able to find here a lot of interesting sites, with a really cool idea.

In this account you can find everything related to web development. Here are my other accounts for you, if you are interested:
